ALGORITHM:

1. Start the bet
2. Take the dealer's cards
3. Define the value of the cards
4. Perform a computation to determine the next move.
5. IF the value of the two cards is below 17, take a hit and get the third card
6. ELSE IF the value of the two cards is 18 to 20, remain with the sum and stand with it
7. See results if win or lose


PSEUDOCODE:

int x <-- dealer's cards value

IF x is less than or equal to 17 THEN
OUTPUT "Take another hit"

ELSE IF x is greater than 18 or equal to 20 THEN
OUTPUT "Stand with the value"
